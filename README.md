Procedural Terrain Generator

Built as a way to learn OpenGL as well as advanced my skills in C++
Lots of errors, redudant code, and bad programming practices are likely
scattered throughout.

Currently November 2025, started studying CS in Janruary 2025.

Files such as Shader.h/.cpp and Camera.h/.cpp are from the LearnOpenGL textbook
Files such as Noise.h/.cpp are from other github users (proper credit in file)
AI tools such as OpenAI ChatGPT and Microsoft CoPilot aided in debugging and learning

Still lots of work to be done, but will likely remake the project as a whole in order to
follow a better structure as well as reflect skills learned in the future.

Suggestions, criticism, and advice is much appreciated.
